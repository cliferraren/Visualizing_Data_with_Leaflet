# Unit 17 | Assignment - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS.

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Using the pulled data from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), we created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.

Visualization markers properly reflects the magnitude of the earthquake using the size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appears larger and darker in color. Also, popups are there to provide more information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

A second data plot will be addded on the map visualization to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.
