Visualizing Data with Leaflet

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

We are to make visialization of earthquakes and data are pulled source from the United States Geological Survey, or USGS   [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

Using the  data, we created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.

Visualization markers properly reflects the magnitude of the earthquake using the size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appears larger and darker in color. Also, popups are there to provide more information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

A second data plot will be addded on the map visualization to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.
